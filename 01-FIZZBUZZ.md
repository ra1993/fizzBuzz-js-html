## Fizzbuzz, now with Javascript

Create an html page with a button and an empty div. When the user clicks the
button insert the numbers from 1 to 50 enclosed in a `<p></p>` or in a list
element into the innerHTML of the empty div.

In the place of a multiple of 3, output "Fizz"

In the place of a multiple of 5, output "Buzz"

In the place of a number that is a multiple of both, output "FizzBuzz"
